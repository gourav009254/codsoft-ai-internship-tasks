AI Projects Collection ü§ñ
Overview
This repository contains three AI projects showcasing different aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning:

Tic-Tac-Toe AI

Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

Image Captioning

Each project focuses on a different domain‚Äîgame theory, natural language processing, and computer vision‚Äîand provides hands-on experience with fundamental AI concepts.

Projects
1. Tic-Tac-Toe AI üïπÔ∏è
An AI agent that plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a human. It uses the Minimax algorithm (optionally with Alpha-Beta Pruning) to play optimally, making it unbeatable.

Features:

Human vs AI gameplay

Minimax search algorithm implementation

Option for Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization

Usage:
Run the Tic-Tac-Toe script and play against the AI in the console.

bash
cd tic-tac-toe-ai
python tic_tac_toe.py

2. Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses ü§ñ
A simple chatbot that replies to user inputs based on predefined rules using if-else statements or pattern matching. This project introduces basic natural language processing and conversation flow.

Features:

Keyword or pattern matching for user input

Rule-based responses

Easy to extend with more rules

Usage:
Run the chatbot script and interact with the bot in the terminal.

pgsql
cd chatbot-with-rule-based
python chatbot.py

3. Image Captioning üñºÔ∏èüìù
An AI system that generates natural language descriptions for images. Uses pre-trained CNN models like VGG or ResNet to extract image features and RNN or transformer-based models to generate captions.

Features:

CNN-based image feature extraction

RNN/Transformer caption generation

Pretrained model usage for better accuracy

Usage:
Run the captioning script with an input image to receive a generated caption.

arduino
cd image-captioning
python caption.py --image path/to/image.jpg
